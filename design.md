Design Document
===============

The theme is Ancient Technology.
We could do it by doing technology of the 80s and 70s? "Ancient"
Or actual ancient stuff, such as old clockwork.
or high tech ancient stuff.

Fixing clocks?
Power source (hand crank) -> Power storage and regulation (spring / pendulum) -> gears -> display (watch hands)

"Ancient" but higher tech than ours?
crystals? analogue computer.
cystals process input.
Connections can't overlap.
