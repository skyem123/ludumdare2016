Design Document
===============

The theme is Ancient Technology.
We could do it by doing technology of the 80s and 70s? "Ancient"
Or actual ancient stuff, such as old clockwork.
or high tech ancient stuff.

Fixing clocks?
Power source (hand crank) -> Power storage and regulation (spring / pendulum) -> gears -> display (watch hands)

"Ancient" but higher tech than ours?
crystals? analogue computer.
cystals process input.
Connections can't overlap.

Yeah, we could make it so the output values score based upon margin of error
But my design calls for a few types of crystals:
Emitter crystals, which would deliver a value across their connections
Receiver crystals, which accept signals and gives you the score based upon margin of error
Function crystals, which take in so many inputs (depends on what function the function crystal performs) and returns one or more outputs
And restrictor crystals, which accept one input and return zero or one output
Restrictor crystals would be things like "only allow odd numbers through"
```
